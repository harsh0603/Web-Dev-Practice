            <p >Space technology is technology for use in travel or activities beyond Earth's atmosphere, for
                purposes such as spaceflight or space exploration. Space technology includes space vehicles such as
                spacecraft, satellites, space stations and orbital launch vehicles; deep-space communication;
                in-space propulsion; and a wide variety of other technologies including support infrastructure
                equipment, and procedures.

                The space environment is a sufficiently novel environment that attempting to work in it often
                requires new tools and techniques.</p>

            <p>Many common everyday services for terrestrial use such as weather forecasting, remote sensing,
                satellite navigation systems, satellite television, and some long-distance communications systems
                critically rely on space infrastructure. Of the sciences, astronomy and Earth science benefit from
                space technology.[1] New technologies originating with or accelerated by space-related endeavors are
                often subsequently exploited in other economic activities.</p>

                    <p>
                        Conventional inflight connectivity via air-to-ground (ATG) networks is prohibitively expensive,
                        working only in particular circumstances. However, LEO satellite constellations enable
                        high-speed satellite connectivity and have the potential to disrupt the aviation internet
                        market. These satellite constellations also open up possibilities for IoT-based solutions for
                        in-flight operations. The same technology extends internet connectivity to rural off-the-grid
                        locations as well.

                    <p>
                        Traditionally, satellites are large objects and typically need a lot of time and money to be
                        placed in orbit. However, with advances in space tech, startups are now able to rapidly develop
                        small satellites at a fraction of the cost. Some satellites weigh as little as 1-10 kg and are
                        known as nanosatellites. Additionally, these are easy-to-upgrade systems that usually
                        participate as members of nanosatellite constellations to advance space communication
                        technologies.

                    <p>
                        Among other things, the success of a satellite depends on ground-based elements such as earth
                        stations, mission control, remote terminals, and other facilities. The ground segment
                        infrastructure is often expensive to operate and maintain compared to more cost-effective
                        solutions, designed for small satellites. This provides the necessary encouragement for startups
                        to develop solutions for the advancement in space technology.

                    <p>
                        Satellites communicate amongst others in the constellation as well as transmit signals back to
                        earth. With the growth in small satellites, most of them just a few inches across, more space
                        tech startups are putting up constellations of satellites in the orbit. As a result, the
                        communication needs of new satellites within constellations are inspiring new advances in
                        communication systems.

                    <p>
                        The propellant constitutes a large part of a rocket’s weight. Electric propulsion enhances the
                        performance of thrusters, and delivers equivalent thrust, with a fraction of the propellant
                        required for chemical thrusters. As a result, rocket systems become more mass-efficient and the
                        cost of launches is reduced. Electric propulsion also considerably increases the lifetime of
                        satellites, ultimately extending mission durations.

            <p>While these tips will surely help you become a better front-end designer, in the long run, you must
                always remember two things while designing your platform – keep it simple and neat, and don’t forget to
                create your signature style.</p>
